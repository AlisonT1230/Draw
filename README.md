# DRAW!

A host computer can start a local flask server and other computers/mobile devices can connect to it if they are on the same internet connection.

Drawing is updated in real time so users can see each other draw and contribute to one community canvas.

Goals:
- Learn how to use Python Flask
- Make a cool drawing tool that works for multiple users at once

Includes:
- Lots of JavaScript
- Fun
